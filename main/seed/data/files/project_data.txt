Project Name: Comprehensive System Monitor (CSM)
Goal: Develop a comprehensive monitoring tool for MacOS that tracks network connections, file changes, and process activity, alerting the user to any suspicious activity.
Features:
1. Network Monitor: Logs all incoming and outgoing network connections, including IP addresses, ports, and geolocation information if possible. Flags connections to known malicious IPs or unusual ports.
2. File Change Monitor: Monitors user-specified directories for changes, including creation, modification, or deletion of files. Flags unexpected or large numbers of changes.
3. Process Monitor: Logs all process activity, including process creation, termination, and CPU/memory usage. Flags processes with high resource usage, uncommon processes, or processes with suspicious behavior such as attempting to access protected files.
Technology Stack:
* Primary language: Python
* Database: SQLite (for ease of setup and use)
* Possible additional libraries: psutil (for process monitoring), requests (for geolocation of IPs), watchdog (for file change monitoring), python-geoip (for geolocation)
Development Steps:
1. Environment Setup: Setup a Python development environment and install necessary libraries.
2. Database Setup: Create a SQLite database with necessary tables for logging network connections, file changes, and process activity.
3. Network Monitor Development: Develop the network monitor feature. This should run continuously in the background, logging all network connections and checking against a list of known malicious IPs or unusual ports.
4. File Change Monitor Development: Develop the file change monitor feature. This should allow the user to specify directories to monitor, and should log any changes in these directories.
5. Process Monitor Development: Develop the process monitor feature. This should run continuously in the background, logging all process activity.
6. Alert System Development: Develop an alert system that flags suspicious activity, such as connections to known malicious IPs, unexpected file changes, or suspicious process activity.
7. Testing: Thoroughly test all features and fix any bugs. Ensure that the system runs smoothly and doesn't use excessive system resources.
8. Documentation: Document all features, usage instructions, and any necessary troubleshooting steps.

main.py
This is the main entry point for the program.   
* main(): Main function, starts the network, file, and process monitors.
config.py
This module will contain configuration constants.
* MONITORED_DIRS: List of directories to be monitored for file changes.
* SUSPICIOUS_IPS: List of known suspicious IPs.
* SUSPICIOUS_PROCESSES: List of known suspicious process names.
network_monitor.py
This module will contain the functionality for network monitoring.
    * class NetworkMonitor: Class for the network monitor.
    * __init__(self): Constructor, initializes network monitor.
    * start_monitoring(self): Starts monitoring network traffic.
    * log_connection(self, connection): Logs a network connection.
    * check_suspicious(self, connection): Checks if a network connection is suspicious.
file_monitor.py
This module will contain the functionality for file change monitoring.
    * class FileMonitor: Class for the file monitor.
    * __init__(self, dirs): Constructor, initializes file monitor with list of directories to monitor.
    * start_monitoring(self): Starts monitoring file changes.
    * log_change(self, change): Logs a file change.
    * check_suspicious(self, change): Checks if a file change is suspicious.
process_monitor.py
This module will contain the functionality for process monitoring.
    * class ProcessMonitor: Class for the process monitor.
    * __init__(self): Constructor, initializes process monitor.
    * start_monitoring(self): Starts monitoring process activity.

alert_system.py
This module will handle alerts for suspicious activity.
    * class AlertSystem: Class for the alert system.
    * __init__(self): Constructor, initializes alert system.
    * send_alert(self, type, details): Sends an alert about suspicious activity. The type parameter specifies the type of alert (network, file, or process), and the details parameter contains information about the suspicious activity.
